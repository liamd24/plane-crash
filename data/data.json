The failure of the captain in charge of the flight to exercise the proper degree of fare by not checking his altimeters to determine whether both were correctly set and properly functioning before commencing his landing approach. A substantial contributing factor was the absence of an established uniform cockpit procedure on Eastern Air Lines by which both the captain and co-pilot are required to make a complete check of the controls and instruments during landing operations. Captain Edward Rickenbacker, President of Eastern Air Lines, survived the crash."

There was no fire in the plane prior to impact. No evidence of sabotage was discovered. There was no power plant failure prior to the accident, and the engines were functioning normally at the time the plane struck the ground. Nothing was found to indicate that there had been any structural failure or failure of the control system of the plane. As a result of the complete destruction of some portions of the plane, it was impossible to eliminate the possibility that such failure occurred. The probable cause of the accident was listed by the CAB as undetermined."

They departed Archerfield (Brisbane) at 0622 EST and refuelled at Charleville, Cloncurry, and Daily Waters, departing from Daily Waters at 1655 Central Standard time. From there a chain of events happened and they remained lost in scattered thunderstorms and drizzle and the blacked out North, being told by Darwin D/F that they were over a hundred miles north of where they really were, due to the inadequacies of the equipment at that time of day, the storms and long distance. In an attempt to force land before running out of fuel, they probably had an engine failure from fuel starvation in the lower engine as they oozed around in a slow turn where the captain would have been peering forward out of an open window, trying to locate a lighter (more grassy) spot in the bush to put down in rain. They probably would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top. The wreckage was found on 6/22/1943.\n\n\nWe feel that they would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top as one wing was undamaged and removed from the site when it was found.\n\nLockheed 14s were renown as nasty buggers at low speed on one engine."

The most accepted explanation is the pilot was not instrument rated and flew into worsening weather conditions and possibly carburetor icing caused an engine failure causing the plane to crash into the English Channel."

The 12 ton plane smashed a 20 ft. hole in the building. Fuel from the ruptured gas tanks poured out and set two floors ablaze killing 10 people. One engine exited the south side of the building and plunged into a penthouse below.  The second engine entered an elevator shaft and severed the cables plunging the car and the elevator operator 1,000 feet into a sub basement.

Several hours later, the remaining engines overheated and the No.2 engine caught fire causing the plane to crash. Gene Roddenberry (creator of Star Trek) was a deadheading Pan Am pilot aboard, who helped rescue many of the passengers.  The crash was blamed on Pan Am's failure to replace the No. 2 engine which had experienced several problems earlier.  A fire which resulted from an attempt to feather the No. 2 propeller after the failure of the No. 2 engine thrust bearing. The aircraft was named Clipper Eclipse."

The crash occurred shortly after the aircraft entered an area of severe turbulence with thunderstorm activity. The wreckage was never found but was believed to be located in 150 feet of water and  not recoverable because it was in 30 feet of silt and an area of extremely poor visibility. The forecast of a squall line in the areas was not made available to the crew. Cause unknown."

Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height between 1,000 and 2,000 feet, the aircraft became unstable, lost height and crashed in a huge explosion in a field located two miles from the airfield. Several eye-witnesses reported that the aircraft lost some pieces before it came down. Investigations determined that following the failure of a part of the right aileron, it detached from the wing, causing severe vibrations. The crew tried to maintain a flat attitude but the aircraft banked left and right and then went into a spin when both wings separated due to aerodynamic forces that exceeded their certification. In such conditions, control was impossible."

At 0801 the flight reported it reached cruising altitude and was headed toward Whitehall Range Station. This message was acknowledged. The next message from the flight was at 08:14 stating that it was over Whitehall Range Station and starting descent. Butte acknowledged this message and  gave the flight the altimeter setting of 29.97, advised that the wind was south, calm, and the ceiling was lower to the east and north and better to the south and southwest. The flight replied that it had vertical visibility at 10,500 feet. This was the last radio contact with the flight. At approximately 0815 the aircraft had struck the eastern slope of a ridge about 30 feet below its crest, at an altitude of about 8,250 feet MSL. The site of impact was approximately 2 1/2 miles east of the control tower at the Butte Airport, and about 1-1/2 miles to the right of the center of the on course signal from Whitehall to Butte. Captain's failure to follow prescribed approach procedures."

Neither of its 2 low-frequency receivers were tuned to the Oakland station and the captain may have attempted to fly by visual reference using the ADF.

Minutes later the aircraft gradually descended, its left wing dropped and the aircraft struck the roof of a vacant building. Hold-down studs in the number 10 cylinder of the right engine failed due to improper installtion of their nuts. Fire erupted at the base of the failed cylinder. Extension of the landing gear and loss of the right engine led to the aircraft stalling at the height of about 200 ft. The aircraft was also overloaded by 117 pounds. A stall with the landing gear extended following a serious loss of power from the right engine. This loss of power was caused by the failure of the hold-down studs of the No. 10 cylinder, precipitating a fire in flight which became uncontrollable."

The co-pilot took over control and meanwhile the steward had come up to the cockpit to find out what was going on. As he knocked, the hijacker shot him twice through the cockpit door, killing him. The co-pilot changed course to China and continued at 6000 feet over the China Sea until two Chinese Nationalists T-6 Harvard planes showed up. Both planes chased the DC-3 and sprayed machine gun fire. The pilot managed to escape until he met with other Nationalist planes, who forced the flight to land at Quemoy. At Quemoy the hijacker was arrested."

Both planes were traveling about 320 mph. Both aircraft were flying in uncontrolled airspace. All  fifty-eight on the DC-7 and seventy on the Constellation killed. The pilots did not see each other in time to avoid the collision. It is not possible to determine why the pilots did not see each other, but the evidence suggests that it resulted from any one or a combination of the following factors: 1) Intervening clouds reducing time for visual separation 2) Visual limitations due to cockpit visibility 3) Preoccupation with normal cockpit duties. This is the accident that led to the adoption of the Air Route Traffic Centers that track planes across the country and the formation of the FAA."

Binstock, 62, a retired North Hollywood jeweler, intent on suicide, detonated a bomb in the rear lavoratory blowing a 6 x 7 ft. hole in the fuselage. Binstock had purchased two insurance policies totaling $125,000 and then flew from Burbank to Las Vegas, where airport personnel at McCarran Field reported he never left the airport terminal. He then boarded the Western Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles and locked himself in the rear lavatory shortly after takeoff. Binstock\u0092s body, missing several fingers on the left hand, was found the next day on a rugged peak in the Ord Mountains south of Daggett."

During the third attempt, as the plane passed V1 (committed to take off) the plane suddenly decelerated, never became airborne, crashed through the barrier fence, into a house and burst into flames. Eight members of the Manchester United football (soccer) team killed. A German inquiry concluded at an accumulation of ice on the wings was the cause of the accident, blaming the captain for not deicing the plane. Ten years later the British reopened the inquiry and concluded the accident was caused by slush on the last quarter of the runway. The reason other planes had taken off without incident was because they lifted in the air using only two thirds of the runway. The accident plane, because of the engine boosting, went further down the runway to take off. The aircraft was named \"Lord Burghley.\""

The ceiling was reported indefinite, 200 feet, visibility, 2 miles in drizzle and fog. A precision approach was commenced to the runway. The approach was within tolerances and normal until after passing through GCA minimums, at which time the aircraft went below glide path and the pilot was instructed to take a waveoff. The waveoff was not executed until after the aircraft had actually made contact with the runway. After climbout, GCA was contacted and a second approach was requested to commence with no delay. The pilot advised GCA that the runway was in sight just before GCA gave him a waveoff on the first approach. The second approach was again normal until the final controller gave the instructions, \"Approaching GCA minimums.\" The aircraft immediately commenced dropping below glide path. An emergency pullup was given, but the aircraft collided with the water and came to rest 2,050 feet east of the approach end of the runway. It sank in 26 feet of water"

J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, who was suffering from the flu, talked Waylon Jennings into giving up his seat. Ritchie Valens won a coin-toss and went in place of Tommy Allsup. He commented \"I never won anything in my life\" after winning the coin-toss. The plane took off into deteriorating weather conditions. The pilot, Roger Peterson, was not certified to fly IFR. The wreckage of the plane was found the next morning in a snowy meadow, 5 miles NW of the airport. The plane hit the ground at a high rate of speed and singers Ritchie Valens, 17, Buddy Holly, 22, Jiles P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, 28, as well as the pilot, were killed instantly. It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground.  Officially: The pilot's decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed. Potter stated the pilot radioed he had taken on ice and was losing power."

Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain's altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator."

The aircraft was then dived in an  effort to attain sufficient airspeed to drive the propellers out of the feathered positions by wind-milling.  At the same time, multiple attempts were made to relight one or more engines. Successful relights were either interrupted by auto-feather action initiated by premature advancing of the throttles prior to complete light up of an engine or prevented by insufficient battery electrical energy. No. 4 engine was eventually  relit and the crew had just successfully relit No. 3 engine when the aircraft crashed."

This abrupt and intermittent loss and recovery of power resulted in the aircraft yawing to the left and decelerating to the stall speed. As speed decayed during the continued yaw and skidding left turn, the stall speed was reached; the left wing dropped, the nose pitched up, and the aircraft rolled left into a spin and fell almost vertically into the water. An altitude of less than 150 feet precluded recovery."

Other passengers fell from the Connie as the spinning fuselage fell onto Staten Island. The United jet tried to make an emergency landing at La Guardia Airport but could not maintain altitude and crashed into the streets of Brooklyn. Forty-four people on the Constellation and eight-four people on the DC-8 were killed. Three passengers from the DC-8 died shortly after. One young boy, Stephen Baltz survived several days before succumbing to his injuries. Six people were also killed on the ground. The United crew entered a low-altitude holding pattern at 500 miles per hour, twice the speed it should have been going and flew past the clearance limits and airspace allocated to the flight. One of 2 VORs on the DC-8 was not functioning. Although the crew knew this, they failed to report this to the ATC, who probably would have provided extra radar assistance."

In the darkness, with no ground reference, the runway lights gave him insufficient guidance as to his height and angle of approach and he was unaware that the aircraft had descended to ground level. The fatigue of the captain and the failure to illuminate the aircraft's landing lights were conributing factors."

It took off from Salisbury Airport, and shortly after take-off suddenly dipped its right wing. After a slow recovery, it climbed away to between 100 - 150 ft and then went into a turn to the left with the port propeller windmilling. This turn continued to get steeper until the aircraft rolled over and dived inverted to the ground . The accident was caused by failure of the pilot to execute a successful single engine forced landing after concluding that there had been a power loss in the port engine. Evidence indicated that a failure of the port engine did not, in fact, occur. The pre-take-off rudder trimmer check was not carried out correctly as laid down in the checklist, and the aircraft took off with full left rudder trim applied. Once airborne this was misinterpreted as port engine failure, and the port propeller was feathered. No apparent action was taken by the pilot to correct the ensuing critical speed yaw."

A rudder control malfunction which caused  a full unwanted rudder deployment, yaw, sideslip and roll which led to loss of control of the aircraft. This was caused by the use of an improper tool at the manufacturing plant to wrap the rudder servo unit's wiring, damaging the wires and leading to a short circuit. There is speculation that the accident was actually caused by the captain putting the aircraft in a steep 45 degree bank which resulted in the loss of control of the aircraft."

A go-around was attempted from this position and the aircraft banked and veered sharply to the left. Initial ground contact was made by the left wing tip approximately 550 feet to the left of the runway centerline. The aircraft progressively disintegrated as it  moved across the ground, then struck heavy earth-moving-equipment parked approximately 970 feet from the runway centerline. The accident was caused by the attempted three-engine go-around, when the aircraft was in a full landing configuration, at insufficient airspeed and altitude to maintain control.

The aircraft initially entered an area of updrafts followed by downdrafts which put the aircraft into a high speed dive. While trying to pull out of the dive, the aircraft broke apart from excessive g forces. The crew is believed to have concentrated on maintaining a given airspeed in an extreme turbulence condition instead of flying attitude. In doing so, excessive stress was applied to the wings which separated from the fuselage. The weather was considerably worse than forecast."

The ignition source was never determined, but it is thought the plane's battery or something in a passenger's luggage caused the fire.  Testing revealed lethal amounts of CO2 could be discharged into the cockpit instead of the lower baggage compartment. The plane was seen flying erratically and the fire eventually burned through the controls.  It is likely the crew was unconscious by then."

The EAL captain had the illusion that a potential collision course existed. As a result of this illusion, a descent was initiated.

Officially, a cause could not be determined. The aircraft was dispatched illegally without an operating CVR. Possible misread altimeter. The crew could have read the altimeter as 16,000 instead of  6,000 ft. and continued a descent below what they were cleared for. Possible excessive sink rate. Excessive sink rate is thought to have possibly caused four 727 accidents in succession. Lake Michigan 8/16/65, Cincinnati 11/8/65, Salt Lake City 11/11/65 and Tokyo Bay 2/4/66. Only the Salt Lake and Cincinnati crashes were officially attributed to it. After 727 training manuals were modified and pilots were reoriented to the flying characteristics of the aircraft the problem was corrected."

The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard.\nAt the time of the accident, the B-52G was carrying four B28FI Mod 2 Y1 thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs, all of which fell to the surface. Three were found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares in the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora, Almer\u00eda, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a 0.77-square-mile area with radioactive plutonium. The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a search lasting 2 1/2  months."

In addition the flight engineer instructor was being given a routine proficiency check. The flight departed the ramp at 00:40 with the captain trainee in the left seat and the check captain in the right seat. At 00:43 the crew advised the tower they were ready for takeoff and would like to circle and land on Runway 1. The tower cleared them as requested. The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19. The tower controller observed Flight 9877 in a shallow left turn on what appeared to be a normal final approach. The degree of bank increased to approximately 60 degrees or greater when the aircraft hit the power lines approximately 2,300 feet short and 1,100 feet west of the runway threshold. The DC-8 crashed into a residential area, destroying several homes and a motel complex. Improper supervision by the instructor and the improper use of flight and power controls by both instructor and the captain trainee during a simulated two-engine out landing approach."

The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway."

As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight.."

According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades."

            "Summary": "The aircraft crashed into Santa Monica Bay shortly after a night takeoff in poor weather and visibility. The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and it\u0092s generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function.\" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the \"OFF\" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses. The galley switches were similar in shape and size and were located on the flight engineer's upper panel in close proximity to the battery switch. Following the accident, the flight engineer\u0092s panel was redesigned to place a guard over the battery switch."

By this time, the plane was very low on fuel and the crew chose to divert to St. Croix. While trying to make St. Croix, the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched into the sea, 35 miles from shore, sinking in 5,000 ft. of water. Improper management of fuel by the crew. Continued, unsuccessful attempts to land at St. Maarten until insufficient fuel remained to reach an alternate airport. A contributing factor was rain showers in the approaching zone not reported to the crew. Inadequate warning given to passengers before the ditching."

Inadvertent deployment of the spoilers by the first officer while the aircraft was still in the air. Faulty design by allowing the spoiler handle to perform two different unrelated tasks (lift to arm and pull to deploy). After the crash McDonnell Douglas denied there was any design flaw and the FAA decided to issue an Airworthiness Directive requiring a warning placard on all DC8s. After two and possibly three more crashed with the same cause an AD was issued requiring a safety lock be installed."

Confronted with steeply rising terrain, the pilot made a sharp bank trying to turn around in the narrowing valley and stalled, crashing into a mountainous forested area on  Mt. Trelease. Numerous members and staff of the Wichita State Football team were killed. The pilot had only 123 total hours in a Martin 404, the copilot 30 hours. Intentional operation of the aircraft over a mountain valley route at an altitude from which the aircraft could neither climb over the obstructing terrain ahead, nor execute a successful course reversal. Other factors included overloaded conditions, lack of a flight planning and minimum qualifications of the crew."

The lightning caused a fire which led to the separation of the right wing and part of the left wing. The aircraft crashed in mountainous terrain in the jungle. One German passenger, a female teenager, survived and was found after trekking through the jungle for 9 days. Juliane Koepcke had a broken collarbone and was unconscious for an unknown amount of time but had survived the crash still strapped in her seat. She fell more than two miles into the jungle canopy but miraculously survived with only minor injuries. When she came to, she set out in vain to find her mother. Maria Koepcke, her mother, a leading Peruvian ornithologist, was dead. Rescue crews searched for the aircraft without success. Koepcke would have to save herself.  Koepcke found a stream and began nine days of wading through knee-high water and fighting off swarms of insects and leeches. On the ninth day, she found a canoe and shelter. Then she waited. Hours later, local lumbermen returned and found her. They tried to get her to eat but she was quite sick and refused. Insects had buried eggs in her skin and they were beginning to hatch. One of the men poured gasoline on her and, as she told the London Daily Mail, \"I counted 35 worms that came out of my arms alone.\" The men offered what assistance they could provide but it was too late in the day to start the journey back to civilization; she slept one more night in the jungle before the men took her on the final seven hour journey via canoe down the river to a lumber station where she was airlifted to a hospital."

As the plane descended into clouds it ran into turbulence and the crew found themselves surrounded by mountains on all sides. The crew tried to climb out but the right wingtip struck the mountainside. The right wing detached and separated from the aircraft taking off part of the tail. The fuselage slid down a mountain slope and came to rest in the Andes mountains at an altitude of 12,000 feet. The survivors were not found until 12/22/72. Eight passengers died in an avalanche on October 30. Survivors resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. The book and movie \"Alive\" is based on this accident. The aircraft flew into a rotor zone or mountain wave which led to loss of control of the aircraft."

With no ground reference and  under nighttime conditions, the aircraft gradually descended until it crashed into Everglades, 18.7 miles west-northwest of Miami. The failure of the crew to monitor the flight instruments during the final 4 minutes of flight, and to detect a descent soon enough to prevent impact with the ground. After spare parts from the L-1011 were used on other planes, apparitions of the captain, Robert Loft and flight engineer, Don Repo began to be reported by Eastern employees. The book \"The Ghost of Flight 401\"and movies \"The Ghost of Flight 401\" and \"Crash\" are based on this accident. Three passengers and one crew member died in weeks following the accident making the total 103."

When they did not get any answer from Marina control, they initiated the turn without clearance. While in the midst of an overcast, the Convair collided with the DC-9. The CV-990 lost an outboard portion of its left wing and managed to carry out an emergency landing at Cognac-Ch\u00e2teaubernard Air Base. The DC-9 lost control and crashed.

The aircraft lost control and crashed in a forest at a high rate of speed. The service subcontractor and the flight engineer neglected to check the locking mechanism through a recently installed viewport to verify the door was latched properly. In addition, although a service bulletin stipulated that the locking pin should be extended, it was mistakenly shortened causing the latch to release after the cabin was pressurized. On June 12, 1972, an American Airlines DC-10 lost its cargo door shortly after taking off from Detroit ,Michigan. Using mainly engine thrust the crew was able to land safely. The cause was a defect in the latching mechanism on the door."

The KLM plane began its takeoff roll without permission with the Pan Am plane still on the runway. The controller and Pan Am pilot each radioed a warning to the KLM plane, but were not heard because the simultaneous transmissions interfered with each other.Just as it was taking off, the KLM plane hit the Pan Am plane that was still on the runway. Both planes burst into flames.  KLM 234 + 14 crew,  Pan Am 326 + 9 crew killed. All aboard the KLM plane were killed. The KLM captain was their safety officer and for some months had  been training other pilots using a simulator, where getting takeoff permission was not simulated. The Pan Am aircraft was named Clipper Victor. The KLM aircraft was named Rhine River. Despite all the circumstances the KLM plane was blamed for taking off without permission by the NTSB."

New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter. No restrains used by the passengers."

Then a sudden tail wind increases the speed to 155 kt. Cross winds from several directions made the plane unstable. Tail winds alternated with frontal winds making the speed unstable. The plane only hit the runway after 800m. The same cross winds make it impossible to align to the center of the runway. Then aquaplaning did the rest."

Also the flight engineer disabled the GPWS alarm so the crew could hear one another better. In addition, the night flight had been diverted from its primary airport due to poor weather and was required to execute a compressed approach (descending and approaching more quickly and steeply than normal), and the crucial altimeter readout was an old drum-roll-counter type (due to be replaced), which could easily be misread, especially in  heavy workload situations. Three fatalities occurred when the frightened passengers grabbed their seat cushions and exited the plane from the rear. They drowned in part because their seat cushions were not flotation cushions. The airplane was not required to have floatation cushions because it was not flying over water."

The crew tried to make an emergency landing in a large clearing in the bush. The aircraft crash landed, striking an irrigation ditch, cart-wheeled, broke up and caught fire.  Soldiers from the Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe Peoples Revolution Army, who were responsible for shooting down the airliner, later killed 10 of the 18 survivors. The remaining survivors were rescued the next day."

The ATC failed to realize from the PSA transmissions that they lost sight of the Cessna. One hundred thirty-five killed on the PSA, two on the Cessna and seven on the ground. Crew fatigue may have played a part in the accident as there are unofficial reports that the crew attended an all night party and had only 2 hours sleep from the night before."

Highest single plane death toll in U.S. aviation history. Asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems caused by separation of the engine and pylon. Improper maintenance procedures used by American Airlines when dismounting the engines for maintenance, by removing the pylon and engine together, putting strain on the engine mounts leading to  stress cracks."

As a result of these conditions, the flight crew could not resolve the instrumentation anomalies to determine proper aircraft attitude reference, and became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed aerodynamic loads which exceeded design limits of the aircraft and caused it to break up in flight."

Ice which accumulated on the engine pressure probes resulted in erroneously high Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) readings. When the throttles were set to takeoff EPR, the engines were actually developing significantly less than takeoff thrust. The crew's inexperience in icing condtions was a contributing factor."

The plane was an estimated 10-11 feet off the ground traveling at approximately 120 - 150 knots during final impact. Several other members of the group were inside the bus but were not hurt. The pilot,  Andrew Aycock's medical certificate (3rd class) had expired, making his pilots license invalid.

As the flight crew kept trying heavy control inputs, they worked the cables loose enough to regain some control. Diverting to Anchorage, they were barely able to descend by stopping a second engine.  On the second attempt they were able to get low enough to land safely. The cause of the prop separation was not determined since it fell into the ocean"

The aircraft ran out of fuel at 41,000 feet. With only standby instruments (magnetic compass, artificial horizon, airspeed indicator and altimeter) and no slats or flaps, the plane landed safely on a 7,200 ft. runway at Gimli, a former Air Force base converted into a racing drag strip. The plane became known as the \"Gimli Glider.\"  The TV movie Falling from the Sky: Flight 174 was made about this incident in 1995."

During the second penetration, the airliner was shot down by a Russian Su-15 Air Force fighter with air-to-air missiles. The aircraft crashed into international waters in the Sea of Japan. U.S. Representative from Georgia Lawrence McDonald killed. Because of an improper navigational setting the plane drifted off course. There was a U.S. spy plane in the vacinity of the 007 flight. The 007 plane was mistaken for the spy plane. The fighter pilot was ordered by Soviet command to shoot down the plane. Two air-to-air missiles were launched by the  fighter and struck the Boeing 747. Cabin pressure was lost and the aircraft suffered control problems, causing the plane to go into a dive and break up, crashing into the ocean."

Witnesses observed the aircraft's main rotor blades stop, the aircraft descended rapidly, struck the top of a chain link fence at a river pier, crashed into the HudsonRiver and sank in 15 to 20 feet of water. Investigation revealed the sprag clutch was inadequately lubricated, had 'rolled over' in the opposite direction of its design and the sprag assembly was damaged. Several sprags and both activating springs were broken and different size sprags were installed. An unauthorized, overhauled clutch had been installed in the aircraft. Dornacker had survived another helicopter crash earlier in the year."

Radar contact was lost 9 minutes into the flight. The crash site was found on the 3rd day of searching in the San Bernardino Mountains. An investigation revealed the aircraft flew, inverted, into a solid wall of granite between two mountain peaks at an altitude of 3,750 feet  and at an estimated speed of 560 mph. The aircraft was literally pulverized into the granite. The \"maximum climb\" takeoff, g forces associated with this type of flight and the dense cloud cover negatively affected the pilots ability to know his position and aircraft attitude."

The fire caused incapacitation and disorientation of the crew, in-flight break-up and loss of control of the aircraft.  The fire originated in a front pallet on the right side in the upper deck cargo hold. The fire of unknown origin possibly (1) incapacitated the crew; (2) caused disorientation of the crew due to thick smoke; (3) caused crew distraction; (4) weakened the aircraft structure, causing an in-flight break-up; (5) burned through control cables or ; (6) caused loss of control due to deformation of the aircraft fuselage. It has been rumored that an unstable substance, not listed on the manifest, was illigally being shipped and started the fire though this has never been proven."

Failure of Aloha Airline's maintenance program to detect the presence of disbonding and fatigue damage which led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing factors were the failure of Aloha Airline's management to properly supervise its maintenance crew as well as the failure of the FAA to properly evaluate the Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and quality control deficiencies. In addition the maintenance program underestimated the need for inspections with the large number of pressurizations/depressurizations and humid salt air climate the plane was subjected to."

            "Summary": "The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner."

Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. As a failsafe, the latches should have been blocked from moving by a mechanism called a \"locking sector\" (one on each latch), engaged manually by a lever after the door is closed.  However, the locking sectors as designed were not strong enough and could be overcome by the motors which was a design flaw right from the introduction of the747.  This was finally recognized as serious, after a non-fatal failure in 1987, but installing stronger locking sectors required taking each plane out of service 10 hours, and the FAA had allowed airlines 18 months so they could do it during other maintenance procedures."

Instead they flew at 270 degrees (west).Therefore, the crew flew in  the wrong direction, even though Belem was north of Maraba and the sun was setting right in front of them. Then they assumed they had overshot Belem and flew straight back east. Then they began following a river which they assumed was the Amazon which would lead them to Belem, but it was the Xingu river. Finally, they  tuned in a radio station and homed in on it assuming it was a Belem station, which it wasn't."

Bolts used to attach the fin to the fuselage were found to be counterfeit and wore much faster that genuine bolts.  Official PC: The accident was caused by loss of control due to the destruction of primary control surfaces in the tail section, which, in turn, was caused by aeroelastic oscillations initiated by abnormal clearances in the vertical stabilizer attachments to the fuselage structure.\nThe condition of the attachments was a result of excessive wear in pins and sleeves used in this structural joint. The pins and sleeves were of an inferior quality and did not satisfy specified values for hardness and tensile strength. They had also been installed and inspected using sub-standard maintenance procedures. Undamped oscillations in the elevator contributed to the structural failure of the empennage.\""

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, except for some parts of the airport which were obscured by low cloud.  Approaching Runway 28, the aircraft was too high to land and the pilot chose instead to enter a right downwind to land on Runway 10.  At approximately 400 feet above ground level on final for Runway 10, the aircraft entered some clouds, the base of which were reported by the tower operator to be at 10 meters.  The aircraft continued its descent, initially striking some trees about 400 feet short of the runway, then shearing off one of the main landing gear on a hillside road about 200 feet prior to the runway.  The aircraft, under full power and nose up, began to climb, but rolled inverted and crashed at the threshold of Runway 10.  The wing fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuselage, trailing fire, slid across the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway.  A fire ensued and airport fire and rescue crews put out the fire within 10 minutes.  Both pilots and one passenger were killed by impact and the remaining four passengers were taken to the hospital with moderate injuries.  The primary cause of the accident was the pilot's decision to descend without visual reference to the surface.  A contributing factor was the negative affect on crew performance that resulted from not using oxygen at 12,000 feet during the flight from Ciudad Guayana."

After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term \"we need priority\" several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say \"we are running out of fuel\" numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger's families."

            "Summary": "At Detroit Metro Airport a ground collision occurred in dense fog. The 727 was on its takeoff roll when the DC-9 taxied onto the active runway. The wingtip of the 727 cut into the fuselage of the DC-9. Lack of proper crew coordination, including virtual reversal of roles by the DC-9 pilots, which led to their failure to stop taxiing and alert ground controller of their positional uncertainty in a timely manner before and after intruding onto the active runway. Contributing to cause of accident were:\n- Deficiencies in ATC services provided by Detroit tower, including failure of ground control to take timely action to alert local controller to possible runway incursion, inadequate visibility observation, failure to use progressive taxi instructions low-visibility conditions, and issuance of inappropriate and confusing taxi instructions compounded by inadequate backup supervision for level of experience of staff on duty;\n- Deficiencies in surface markings, signage and lighting at airport and failure of FAA surveillance to detect or correct any of these deficiencies;\n- Failure of Northwest Airlines to provide adequate cockpit resource management training to line aircrews. Contributing to fatalities was inoperability of DC-9 internal tailcone release mechanism. Contributing to number and severity of injuries was failure of crew of DC-9 to properly execute the passenger evacuation. Eight killed aboard the DC-9. None aboard the B-727."

A Wings West aircraft reporting \"ready for takeoff\", caused some confusion because the controller didn't have a flight progress strip in front of her. The strip appeared to have been misfiled at the clearance delivery position. The USAir, which was cleared to land, struck the rear of the Metroliner. After the collision, both planes slid off the runway into an unoccupied fire station and burst into flames.The failure of the Los Angeles Air Traffic facility management to implement procedures that provided redundancy comparable to the requirements contained in the National Operational Position Standards and the failure of the FAA ATS to provide adequate policy direction and oversight to its ATC facility managers. These failures created an environment in the Los Angeles ATC tower that ultimately led to the failure of the  controller to maintain awareness of the traffic situation, culminating in the inappropriate clearances and the subsequent collision of the USAir and SkyWest aircraft. Twenty-two killed aboard the USAir and all 12 aboard the Metroliner. One additional person died 31 days after the accident making it 35 killed."

Twenty minutes prior to departure, the Nationair lead mechanic made a request for nitrogen to inflate the low tire. Nitrogen was not readily available and a delay would probably have occur procuring it. The Nationair project manager, without conferring with the flight crew, released the plane."

The plane dived out of control until the pilots were able to recover. In clouds, they needed vectors to land safely but ATC could not help until the flight engineer realized he needed to switch the transponder's power supply from engine #4 to #1.  The normal method of dumping fuel, left one tank full for similar reasons. While trying to line up for a Marseille approach, the plane came out of the clouds, the pilots spotted the long runway at Istres, and went there instead.  When they lowered the flaps, fuel leaking from where engine #3 had been was ignited by broken wires. They landed safely but the wing was damaged beyond repair. The maintenance procedure for the engine mounts at that time was not adequate to detect fatigue in certain positions."

The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the captain instead of making a 180 degree turn towards the south, continued the turn to 360 degrees and headed north again. The aircraft eventually flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain interpreted  the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by the captain and ATC. Specifically, the initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, the captain trying to performing too many duties instead of relying on his co pilot,and the use of non-standard phraseology."

The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft. This was the second accident attributed to the same cause. Boeing soon after changed the fuse pin design."

The combination of both factors caused stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. In addition, there were four moments when the pilots should have decided to abort the landing and do a go-around. This because the runway was flooded with water, the plane had left the flight path and was unstable during landing. In addition, the pilots did not properly correct for the windshear, flew too slowly and made errors with the automatic pilot."

Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services."

While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music."

            "Summary": "While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence."

Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover.

The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. The flight crew's lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91."

The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground. Lack of crew response to an extreme nose-down attitude. The investigation concluded that the captain was incapacitated. Just before impact the first officer expressed his concern about the situation of either the captain's incapacitation or the aircraft's attitude and attempted a recovery. The malfunctioning autothrottle was a recurring problem with this airplane that maintenance had been unable to fix because they could not duplicate Pilots were instructed to keep a hand on the throttle to stop it from happening however, this didn't happen because the captain was incapacitated."

While the captain continued the descent the co-pilot carried out the landing gear alternate extension checklist. The plane descended below the minimum safe step-down altitudes for the approach and struck the top of a ridge line. The captain did not ensure the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the non-precision instrument approach. The captain's  unwise decision to get the landing gear lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach. The captain's distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer's attempt  to correct a landing gear malfunction. The GPWS warning may have come too late, apparently because it had trouble handling the uneven terrain in the area. As a result of the police investigation, Captain Garry Sotheran was charged in April 2000 with four counts of manslaughter and three counts of injuring passengers. After a six-week trial at the Palmerston North High Court in June 2001, the jury found Sotheran not guilty on all charges."

He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering on approach, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin and uncontrolled collision with terrain. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot allowed the aircraft weight and balance limitations to be exceeded; the pilot's lack of recurrent training in the make and model of airplane; inadequate maintenance/inspection of the engine exhaust systems; a warped and leaking exhaust system flange on the left engine, which resulted in a loss of power in that engine; and the pilot's improper use of the flaps."

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists."

            "Summary": "The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff into a residential area striking a building. Uncommanded deployment of the thrust reverser on the right engine caused the plane to roll right and lose control. The plane had an automatic system to protect against this situation, but what it did was to simply bring the throttle lever for the affected engine back to idle, without telling the pilot why.  Because Fokker had assessed this scenario as extremely improbable, the airline had not trained the pilots for it.  They did get an alarm but what it said was only that the auto-throttle was not usable, so they naturally assumed that it was the auto-throttle moving the throttle lever wrongly, and pressed it forward again -- so hard that the cable broke."

The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilot\u0092s relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraft\u0092s performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraft\u0092s altitude no longer made this possible."

Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazakstan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight."

The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned."

The accident was caused by the FAA's failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. In addition, Embraer's manual for the aircraft specified correctly that the deicing boots should be activated as soon as icing occured.  But the pilots were trained by Comair's manual, which specified waiting until ice was about 1/2 inch thick."

Loss of the right engine propeller control oil, which led to an overspeed of the right engine and propeller, and necessitated a shut-down of the right engine; and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude/distance from terrain during visual approach for a precautionary landing at an alternate airport. Factors relating to the accident were: fluctuation of the left engine power, premature lowering of the airplane flaps, and an encounter with adverse weather conditions (including high winds, severe turbulence, and white-out conditions) during the approach."

The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge."

The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover."

The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable."

Kennedy's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night."

A fan of computer flight-simulation games, he stated he just wanted to fly a real plane.  After forcing the co-pilot out of the cockpit he ordered the captain to fly to a U.S. Air Force base in western Tokyo. When he refused, he stabbed the captain and seized the controls. After a sudden drop in altitude, the co-pilot and an off duty crew member entered the cockpit and overpowered the hijacker.  A one point the plane plunged to within 984 feet of the ground. The plane ultimately  landed safely but the captain died of his injuries."

The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander's unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander's failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle.\nThe commander's failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown."

The Boeing 757 left the runway at high speed, approximately 1,000m from the second touchdown point. It then ran 343m across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit a number of medium sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then passed through the fence, re-landed in a field and both main landing gears collapsed. It finally stopped after a slide across the field. One passenger, who had been admitted to hospital with apparently minor injuries and discharged the following day, died five days later from unsuspected internal injuries. The destabilisation of the approach below decision height with loss of external visual references and automatic height callouts immediately before landing, resulting in touchdown with excessive descent rate in a nose down attitude. The resulting displacement of the nose landing gear support structure caused disruption to aircraft systems that led to uncommanded forward thrust increase and other effects that severely aggravated the consequences of the initial event."

The first officer advised the captain he should be turning left and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures. Specifically both pilots  had trained in the Soviet Union, where the attitude indicator works differently. Theirs show an icon of the airplane changing position in front of a fixed horizon, mimicking what an observer outside the plane would see if there was daylight; but western type indicators show a fixed airplane icon and an artificial horizon changing position, mimicking what the pilot would see.  Consequently the diagonal line on the display is angled the same way for a right turn on one type as for a left turn on the other type."

While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed."

            "Summary": "While attempting to land at Burbank Airport, the plane overran the runway, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver."

The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. The French government convicted Continental and a Continental mechanic of a crime but an appeals court reversed the decision."

While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a \"spatial disorientation\" to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude."

            "Summary": "Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot\u0092s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen."

A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked \"guard lights\" used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmac at the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing."

Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulic pump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \"Caution\" note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak."

The MD-87 rotated for takeoff and did make it into the air for 9 seconds, but was too damaged to sustain flight. The plane then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport's baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different taxiway and hold short of the runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures and improper terminology used by the tower. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been \"in English and Italian,\" as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility and inadequately marked airport landmarks, the control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood. There was no ground radar, runway motion sensors were turned off and it took 20 minutes before anyone realized the two planes had collided."

The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed."

At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a \"minimum\" warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.  The range of hills the plane crashed into was not marked in the Jeppesen approach chart used by the crew, despite the hilly terrain the approach to runway 28 was not equipped with a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) system, which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated, and the airport's means of determining visibility were inadequate for runway 28 and the visual minimums at the time of the accident were actually inappropriate for using the standard approach to runway 28."

The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final. The flight crew performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air China\u0092s operations and training manuals. \nThe flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captain\u0092s intention to make a timely base turn. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. When the first officer advised the captain to ascend again for landing, about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself."

Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident."

Although the right engine was feathered, flaps and gear retracted and full power applied t the left engine, the plane could not maintain altitude and the pilot ditched the aircraft 15 miles from its destination. All passengers and the pilot were able to exit from the plane before it sank but 2 passengers subsequently died. The in-flight failure of the right engine and the pilot's failure to adequately manage the airplane's performance after the engine failed. The right engine failure resulted for inadequate maintenance that was performed by Air Sunshine's maintenance personnel during undocumented maintenance. Contributing to the passenger fatalities was the pilot's failure to provide an emergency briefing after the right engine failed."

The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance."

Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making."

Also, the pilot chose to take off from a 7,500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10,000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew's failure to ensure that the airplane's wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions."

The flight crew's failure to effectively monitor and maintain airspeed and comply with procedures for deice boot activation on the approach, which caused an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the FAA's failure to establish adequate certification requirements for flight into icing conditions, which led to the inadequate stall warning margin provided by the airplane's stall warning system."

The autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner."

The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar. A contributing factor was the failure of the crew to carry out proper emergency procedures once the plane ran out of fuel. In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, to 10 years of jail for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane's engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Palermo \"Punta Raisi\" Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Witnesses say he succumbed to panic and began praying out loud, rather than attempting to maneuver the plane to the nearest airport."

Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing."

The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine's PT2 probe was responsible for the accident."

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C."

The captain's insufficient pitch control inputs led to a failure to recover the aircraft and caused it to crash. Along with the inadequate control inputs from the captain, the contributing factors of the crash were also the lack of monitoring the aircraft's pitch attitude, altitude and vertical speed by the first officer and no proper reaction by the crew to GPWS warnings."

The flightcrew was cleard to taxi to Runway 22 and subsequently cleared for takeoff. However, flight 5191 used Runway 26, which is about half the length of Runway 22. The plane accelerated to 137 knots befoe it ran off the end of the runway, ran through an airport perimeter fence and impacted trees on an adjacent horse farm and burst into flames. The takeoff sequence took about 36 seconds.  The aircraft was still on the ground as the plane ran off the runway.The plane came to rest about 1,800 feet past the runway. It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances."

Five passengers and two crew members on the Embraer were not injured. All 154 on board the 737 were killed. The flight recorder transcript from the executive jet showed that the pilots were told by Brazilian air traffic control to fly at the same altitude as the Boeing 737 before the planes collided. A Brazilian Air Force investigation concluded that a switched-off transponder on the EMB-135 contributed the plane crash. The report also said flight controllers failed to alert the pilots they were on a collision course and failed to notice the transponder was turned off."

The pilot released the flight controls for nearly one minute without engaging the auto pilot, which could have corrected the banking angle, then at 34 degrees. However, his intervention worsened the tilt. The captain grabed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the banking angle to 50 degrees. When the bank angle increased to 70 degrees, the captain stated \"we are crashing.\" The first officer told him to level the aircraft, but quickly corrected himself and said \"left, left, left captain. The aircraft  then plunged nose down into a mangrove swamp."

The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet."

Everyone was able to evacuate but the plane was destroyed.  Boeing, aware of this failure mode due to past incidents, had ordered the nut at the end of the stop bolt to be glued on but to do this, the maintenance technician had to work awkwardly by feel and had inadvertently lost the associated washer that actually retained the bolt in place."

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point. Corrections in design were made so this would not occur again."

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots  were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain's decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators."

While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall."

The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft's instruments and failed to follow the airline's procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain\u0092s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew\u0092s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew\u0092s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain\u0092s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air\u0092s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions."

            "Summary": "The Airbus went missing over the Atlantic Ocean on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots. \n  The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It's unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed."

The airplane impacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1,100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centerline. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport although they were not once timely informed of the actual weather conditions at Smolensk, which were significantly lower than the established airport minima. Descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for a go-around,  in order to establish visual flight. No reaction to the numerous TAWS warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death of the crew and passengers.\n Polish president Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among the dead."

This applied the brakes, causing a downward pitch force that  prevented the plane from rotating to take off. They made the fatal mistake of failing to abort the takeoff, but kept applying more upward\n  pitch with the result that when the plane finally left the ground and the downward pitch force stopped, it went into a stall within seconds."

Neither pilot noticed the aircraft's speed increasing to its maximum operating speed. The pilot-in-command pulled the power levels of the plane 'quite quickly'. Moments later both propellers over-sped simultaneously. The over-speeding propellers back-drove the turbines in the engines (instead of the engine turbines driving the propellers) and this caused severe damage to the left engine.After the emergency began, the first officer quickly identified the double propeller over-speed. At about the same time, smoke appeared in the cockpit and various aircraft system malfunction alerts activated. The crew did not respond to any of these alerts by implementing the emergency procedures detailed in company manuals and the quick reference handbook."

Inadequate maintenance of the helicopter, including the improper reuse of a degraded self-locking nut, the improper or lack of installation of a split pin and inadequate post maintenance inspections which resulted in the in-flight separation of the servo control input rod from the fore/aft servo and rendering the helicopter uncontrollable."

An investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely, 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with one engine inoperative, in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon; and that during his last flight proficiency test he had not been tested with respect to flying with one engine inoperative."

A stall warning sounded four seconds before the crash, and the crew then made an internal decision \"to initiate a go-around 1.5 seconds to impact.Two passengers were killed and 182 injured. One passenger was run over by one of the emergency vehicles. The crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing.

By the time the two pilots yelled to go around, there was nothing they could do to change the velocity and altitude of the plane in time to prevent a crash. The airport's control tower did not inform the aircraft of local weather conditions.The cause was  pilot error and a failure within the airline to follow safety procedures. The flight crew did not comply with the published runway 20 VOR non-precision instrument approach procedures at Magong Airport with respect to the minimum descent altitude. The captain, as the pilot flying, intentionally descended the aircraft below the published MDA of 330 feet in the instrument meteorological conditions."

Wreckage was found in the northern mali dessert. The plane was on loan from Swiftair. The crew likely did not activate the system during climb and cruise. As a result of the icing of the pressure sensors, the erroneous information transmitted to the auto throttle meant that the latter limited the thrust delivered by the engines. Under these conditions, the thrust was insufficient to maintain cruise speed and the aircraft slowed down and stalled."

The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer, who was flying, became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash. Records show that the plane flew with that mechanical problem for 12 months preceding the accident."

The plane was instructed to enter a holding pattern at 15,000 feet where it remained for a little under two hours. During a second landing attempt, at 3.4 miles from the runway and an altitude of 1,500 feet the crew executed a second go around and climbed to 3,975 feet, after which, the plane went out of control in a nose down attitude and hit the runway at high rate of speed and disintegrated. The accident occurred during the second go around, due to an incorrect aircraft configuration and crew piloting, the subsequent loss of PIC\u0092s situational awareness in nighttime in IMC. This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground."

Two days after the accident, it is confirmed that ACARS messages reported smoke on board, apparently in the lavatory and also in a technical compartment located under the cockpit.The most likely cause was that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aircraft was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft. Probable cause was the pilot smoking in the cockpit along with an oxygen leak which caused the fire."

Among the errors made which caused the crash were the decisions to let the plane take off without enough fuel to make the flight safely and then to not stop midway to refuel. The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late. In addition, as the fuel was running out, they extended the flaps and gear just before the engines stopped, but this caused enough drag that they could no longer glide to the airport. Since the captain was part owner of the small airline, he was motivated to cut fuel costs because the company was in financial trouble."

He had a history of depression, which he concealed when being hired and had just given notice to resign his position over a dispute with another pilot.. The first officer was relatively inexperienced and presumably not in a position to deal with all this."

A woman passenger sitting in the window seat was partially sucked out of the window. Passengers were able to pull her back in the cabin but she was reported in cardiac arrest and soon after died. The crew declared an emergency and landed safely at Philadelphia airport. The accident was caused by a low cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No.13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality."

After taking off from runway 25L, the aircraft made a climbing left-hand turn after which the crew radioed a request to return too the airport. The aircraft then showed an erratic pattern of flight and began losing altitude until it crashed into the sea, 9 miles off the Jakarta coast. It was reported the plane had problems the night before on a flight from Denpasar to Jakarta. When the 737 Max 8 was designed, it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this, the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this, not the pilots or  airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude, it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane, the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude, but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane\u0092s stall speed was reached, and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem."

            "Summary": "Forty-five minutes after taking off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the plane returned to make an emergency landing. About 16-21nm west of Sheremetyevo Airport there was a thunderstorm. The aircraft was climbing through 7,900 feet when an electrical failure occurred, the flight control system degraded to \"DIRECT MODE\", the autopilot automatically disconnected; the aircraft was in the middle of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft until the end of the flight. The crew decided to return to Sheremetyevo and performed a manual ILS approach to runway 24L. At the time the aircraft intercepted the glideslope the aircraft\u0092s mass was above the maximum landing weight. The crew deployed the flaps to 25 degrees in accordance with the flight crew operating manual for flight with minimum mode (DIRECT MODE) of the FCS as well as landing above MLW. At 15:26Z the crew set the emergency transponder code. Vapp was determined to be 155 KIAS, the descent on the glideslope was stabilised and without any deviation from Vapp. Descending between 1,100 and 900 feet the crew received 5 cycles of predictive windshear warnings. Descending through 260 feet AGL the aircraft began to deviate below the glide slope, a \u0091GLIDESLOPE\u0092 warning occurred. Descending between 180 to 40 feet the engine thrust was increased causing the aircraft to accelerate to 164 knots. At 16 feet AGL the speed was 170 KIAS. A Terrain Awareness Warning System aural signal \u0091Retard\u0092 occurred. The engine thrust was reduced to idle. At that point the captain began to apply oscillating pitch inputs with increasing amplitude which changed the pitch angle up to +6 and -2 degrees. The aircraft made a \"three point\" touchdown 900 meters past the runway threshold at 158 KIAS and a vertical load of +2.55G and bounced up to 6 feet AGL. The spoilers did not deploy. In DIRECT MODE they are not permitted to operate automatically and need to be extended manually, however the spoilers were not manually extended by the crew. Two seconds after the first touchdown the aircraft touched down a second time with the nose gear first at 155 KIAS and +5.85G. The aircraft bounced off again to 18 feet AGL. A third touchdown occurred at 140 KIAS in excess of +5G resulting in the destruction of the construction, a fuel spill and fire."

The crew rejected the takeoff at high speed (at about 130 knots) but wasn't able to avoid contact with the fire truck. As a result of the collision, the right main gear collapsed and caught fire due to the resulting friction against the runway. The aircraft veered right towards the right-hand runway edge coming to a stop partially off the runway about 2500 meters down the runway. Everyone on board was able to evacuate the plane, however, some sustained injuries. Two firefighters in the fire truck were killed. The crash was the result of the emergency vehicles entering the runway without permission. The emergency drill had been poorly planned by the Peruvian Corporation of Commercial Airports and Aviation (CORPAC), and coordination with the airport regarding the drill was poor."
